# PremierLeagueStats

This project uses a free API provided by API-Football.com. I used Python for the backend and HTML and CSS for the frontend in this full-stack project. This project has a very easy-to-use UI with a functional backend. The user enters a team name in the league and any season starting from 2011. This application will return the number of goals scored and the number of games they played in that season.
